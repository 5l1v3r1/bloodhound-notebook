# BloodHound Notebook Project

A community-driven effort to document and share cypher queries via Jupyter Notebooks.

## Use Cases:

* Teach about Neo4j Cypher applied to BloodHound via notebooks
* Capture Input (Cypher Queries) and Output(Results) for documentation/reports purposes
* Automate the execution of several queries in a practical and easy-to-reproduce way
* Allow the InfoSec community to run Cypher Queries interactively through a browser (Nothing installed locally) and for FREE
